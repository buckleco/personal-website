I am currently a stay at home Dad with three young children. When time permits, I love to explore interesting datasets to gain useful insights using various data analytics methodologies and machine learning models. I also like to make useful clear charts. Using R and the accompanying tidyverse ecosystem is my toolkit of choice. Prior to staying at home with the children, I worked for 14 years in the finance industry in London and New York, mainly in risk reporting and analytics. 

This site provides me with a place to consolidate the mini data projects I work on in my spare time. The fact that my output will end up on the internet pushes me to get my work into a shareable state. Addtionally, it is nice to know that some of my posts could also help up-and-coming R programmers.
