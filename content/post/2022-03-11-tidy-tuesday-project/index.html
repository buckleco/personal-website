<p>A number of my posts source data via the ‘Tidy Tuesday’ project, so I thought it would make sense for me to provide some further information on this project. Every Tuesday a new dataset is provided and people are encouraged to wrangle the data and create a visualisation using the R tidyverse (although other code based methodologies are also welcome). People can post their code and output on twitter (#TidyTuesday). The project was originally co-founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/thomas_mock">Thomas Mock</a> in 2018.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">Tidy Tuesday github repository</a> is an excellent starting point to learn more about the project. It contains some background to the project, participant guidelines and guidance, along with all the weekly datasets.</p>
<p>Owing to the popularity of the project, an R package, tidytuesdayR, was also developed. This allows for easy access to the datasets from within R. For example, if I wanted to access the original craft beer dataset I used in <a href="../2022-01-14-interactive-beer-reactable/">this post</a>, I can bring back a list of all the tidy tuesday datasets and then call the relevant dataset using the appropriate tidy tuesday date.</p>
<pre class="r chunk-style"><code># Load tidy tuesday library
library(tidytuesdayR)</code></pre>
<pre class="r chunk-style"><code># Obtain all the available tidy tuesday datasets
# Do a check first to make sure daily query limit has not been reached
# Note, I don&#39;t execute this code here as it returns many, many rows
if (rate_limit_check(quiet = TRUE) &gt; 10) {
  all_available_datasets &lt;- tt_available()
  print(all_available_datasets)
}</code></pre>
<p>The craft beer dataset was used for Tidy Tuesday on July 10th 2018. Therefore, the dataset can be imported via the tidytuesdayR package using this date.</p>
<pre class="r chunk-style"><code># Using the tidy tuesday date sourced from the table above load the dataset
# Do a check first to make sure daily query limit has not been reached
if (rate_limit_check(quiet = TRUE) &gt; 10) {
  craft_beer_data &lt;- tt_load(&quot;2018-07-10&quot;)
  head(craft_beer_data$week15_beers)
}</code></pre>

<p>Also, I found this <a href="https://nsgrantham.shinyapps.io/tidytuesdayrocks/">R Shiny App</a> useful for browsing submissions people made under the #TidyTuesday twitter hashtag. It doesn’t look like it has been updated in a while, but it is still very interesting.</p>
<p>Another good resource is this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL19ev-r1GBwkuyiwnxoHTRC8TTqP8OEi8">list of youtube videos</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/drob?lang=en">David Robinson</a>. In each video David takes a look at a Tidy Tuesday dataset livecoding his analysis and visualisations in R.</p>
<p>If you are searching for inspiration for a small personal data project, then I recommend looking through the datasets in the Tidy Tuesday github repository and checking out the submissions based on those datasets under the #TidyTuesday hashtag on twitter. If you are not on Twitter, then you can access the raw tweets via the github repository. See this <a href="https://themockup.blog/posts/2021-04-01-three-years-of-tidytuesday/#alt-text-for-graphs">article</a> for details on how to do that.</p>
